# Diagonalization, Eigenvectors, and Decomposition

This Jupyter notebook explores the concepts of eigenvalues, eigenvectors, and matrix diagonalization. It demonstrates how to compute eigenvalues and eigenvectors, visualize vectors in 2D, and compare the performance of computing matrix powers using regular methods versus diagonalization.

## Purpose
The purpose of this notebook is to:
- Understand the fundamental concepts of eigenvalues and eigenvectors.
- Demonstrate the diagonalization of a matrix.
- Compare the performance of computing matrix powers using regular methods versus diagonalization.

## Imports
The notebook uses the following Python libraries:
- `numpy` for numerical computations.
- `matplotlib.pyplot` for plotting and visualization.
- `timeit` for performance measurement.


## Visualization
The notebook uses `matplotlib` to plot the original and transformed vectors, demonstrating how eigenvectors remain in the same direction after transformation, while other vectors may change both in magnitude and direction.

## Performance Comparison
The notebook compares the performance of computing matrix powers using regular methods versus diagonalization, highlighting the efficiency of diagonalization for certain computations.
